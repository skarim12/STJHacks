# STJHacks – PowerPoint AI (Production-Ready Demo)

This repo is a **production-ready demo** of an AI system that generates **presentation-quality PowerPoint decks** (content + style + visuals + speaker notes + layout) from a single prompt.

## What this is (today)

- A working demo backend + PowerPoint taskpane add-in.
- A generation pipeline that produces a structured deck JSON, streams progress via SSE, and exports a PPTX.

## What we’re building next

A **publishable GitHub project** with a **web app** UI (primary) and the Office add-in as an optional client.
