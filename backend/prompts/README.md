# AI Prompt Files

This folder documents the prompts/behaviors used by each AI integration.

These `.md` files are primarily **human-readable documentation** so the team can iterate on prompts
without hunting through source code.

If we want to make them *runtime-loaded* prompts later, we can add a small loader utility and wire
routes to read from these files.
